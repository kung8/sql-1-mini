# Project Summary

In this project, we'll be practicing inserting and querying data using SQL. We'll make use of an online database emulator tool found  <a href="https://postgres.devmountain.com/">Here</a>. Careful, if you reload the page your changes will be lost.

On the left are the Tables with their fields. The right is where we will be writing our queries. The bottom is where we will see our results.  

## Step 1

### Instructions

SELECT all the data FROM the artist table.
SELECT * FROM Artist

### Solution



<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solution </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT * FROM artist;
```

</details>

## Step 2

### Instructions

SELECT the first_name, last_name, and country FROM the employee table.

SELECT first_name,last_name, country 
FROM employee

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solution </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, country
FROM employee;
```

</details>

## Step 3

### Instructions

SELECT the name, composer, and milliseconds FROM the track table WHERE the milliseconds are greater than 299000.
SELECT name,composer,milliseconds 
FROM track

SELECT name, composer, milliseconds
FROM track 
WHERE milliseconds > 299000

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solution </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT name, composer, milliseconds
FROM track
WHERE milliseconds > 299000;
```

</details>

## Step 4

### Instructions

SELECT the count FROM the track table WHERE the milliseconds are greater than 299000.

SELECT count(milliseconds)
FROM track 
WHERE milliseconds > 299000

### Solution

<details>

<summary> <code> SQL Solution </code> </summary>

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM track
WHERE milliseconds > 299000;
```

</details>

## Black Diamond 

Now that we have some basic query examples.  Let's try doing some more complicated ones.
Use [www.sqlteaching.com](http://www.sqlteaching.com/) or [sqlbolt.com](http://sqlbolt.com/) as resources for the missing keywords you'll need.

1. Find the average length of all tracks in milliseconds

select avg(milliseconds) 
from track

//393599.2121 milliseconds

2. Find the number of invoices in the USA

select count(*)
from invoice 
where billing_country = 'USA'

3. Make a list of all the First Names of Customers that contain an 'a'

select * 
from customer 
where first_name like '%a%';

4. Make a list of the 10 longest tracks

select * 
from track 
order by milliseconds desc
limit 10


5. Make a list of the 20 shortest tracks

select * 
from track 
order by milliseconds
limit 20

6. Find all the customers that live in California or Washington

select * 
from customer 
where state = 'CA' or state = 'WA'

7. Find all the customers that live in California, Washington, Utah, Florida, or Arizona (Use IN keyword)

select * 
from customer 
where state in ('CA','WA', 'UT','FL', 'AZ')

8. Insert an artist to the database

insert into artist (name)
values ('Ed Sheeran');

9. Insert yourself as a customer to the database

insert into customer (first_name, last_name,email,address,city,state,country,postal_code,phone,fax,company)
values ('Kevin','Ung','ung.kevin78@gmail.com','127 W Birds Eye Lane','Vineyard','Utah','USA','84059','571-623-9450','','DevMountain' );


10. Find a list of all Playlists that start with `Classical` 

select *
from playlist
where name like 'Classical%'

11. You can either continue exploring this dataset or look into setting up postgres on your local machine.
